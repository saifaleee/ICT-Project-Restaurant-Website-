MAIN PAGE 
We designed this website of a fast food restaurant called “OvenBaked”. This is how the main page looks like with an upper bar for navigation to different pages on the website.
When you click on the URL to our website, this screen pops up and from here you can see different options such as HOME, MENU, DEALS, MY CART and LOGIN.
If the user wants to login to his account, He /She will have to click the LOGIN button which will lead the user to the login page.

If the user wants to see the available deals, he/she will use the button “Deals” which will take them to the DEALS page where they can select the deals and then add them to cart if they want to.

The user can directly open the MY CART page from the upper navigation bar and see the items which he/she wants to purchase and then proceed to the PAYMENT page where they will have to pay.
The user can open the PAYMENT from the cart page after selecting the meals he/she wants. He/she will have to select the “Payment” button to go to the payment page.
The lower part of the home page is shown below in the picture.
 
Here, the user can see reviews from different customers who have purchased anything from us. This will give them a better idea of what item could be better for them. Below the reviews tab, is the Social section where the user can reach out to us on our Instagram and Facebook page by clicking on the respective icons. They can also download our app available on the play store and app store by clicking on those icons which will redirect them to another page. The bottom left of the homepage also shows a navigation tab for many other parts of the website.

		MENU
 
The Menu tab shows us different pizza options and details about each specific item .The User can choose to buy simple pizzas such as chicken or vegetable pizza or than can choose the chef’s special’s pizza which are a bit more expensive but more tastier .There is a “Add to cart” button that will be used if a user wants to purchase that item.
 After the item is added, the user can further move to payment tab for checkout.
 
    DEALS
 
The Deals tab works almost the same as the menu tab with a slight difference that instead of purchasing single pizzas, the user can now buy multiple pizzas through different kind of deals which are cheap. The Deals tab shows 3 different deals to select from. The user can use the “Add to cart” button if they are interested in a particular deal. They will have to go to payment tab to clear their bills, as previously stated above.

		LOG IN
 
The Login tab allows users to make new accounts for themselves. If you are an existing member, then you don’t need to create an existing account and can just login with your existing credentials. On clicking sign in (if you are a new user), you will be redirected to a new page where you can make an account.

		SIGN UP  
  
The sign up page allows you to create a new account on the website. The user will have to enter some sort of information like username, Email and a password in order to create an account for themselves. Once they make an account, they can login again into the website through the login page.
 				          
    CART

 The cart tab shows all your items that you want to purchase. Each item has its own price written next to it, so the user can get an idea of how much he has to pay at the end.
At the bottom, there is a button which will redirect you to the payment tab if clicked.

		PAYMENT
 
The payment tab is where the user will enter their credentials and address. They must also select a type of payment from the given options that is 
1.	Cash on delivery
